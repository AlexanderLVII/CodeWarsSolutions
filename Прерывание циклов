Task
Coding in function ```grabDoll```. function accept 1 parameter:```dolls```. it's a string array, a list of some dolls.

You need traverse ```dolls``` by using ```for``` loop. If element is  "Hello Kitty" or "Barbie doll", you should push it to a ```bag```(bag is an array, I've defined in the function); if it's other strings, we should use ```continue``` skip it. 

When the ```bag``` has three element, ```bag``` is full. You should use ```break``` jump out the loop; If ```bag``` is not full, you should traverse ```dolls``` until the last element.

function grabDoll(dolls){
  var bag=[];
  for (let i = 1; i <= dolls.length; i++){
    if (bag.length === 3) break;
    if (dolls[i] === "Hello Kitty" || dolls[i] === "Barbie doll"){
      bag.push(dolls[i]);
    } 
      else continue;
  }
  return bag;
}
